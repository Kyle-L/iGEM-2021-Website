  <h1>About the Wiki</h1>
  <p>
    One of the early goals we set out to accomplish was to develop an intuitive wiki experience catered towards all
    experience levels and employed cutting edge web design principles. We did not want to just improve on the designs of
    other wikis; instead, we wanted to build our wiki from the ground up and create something to not only house all of
    our content for future iGEM teams, but to provide an engaging educational experience. The wiki you see now is the
    product of months of design, iteration, and dedication; it's something we as the Miami University iGEM team are
    remarkably proud to call ours.

  <h2>Built from the Ground Up</h2>

    Early on, we knew that in order to create a wiki that would meet the expectations we set out to meet, we would need
    to build the wiki completely from the ground up and catered towards iGEM's MediaWiki server. Through weeks of
    design, programming, iteration, and testing, we were able to successfully meet that goal. Built with a custom Python
    library, the Miami University 2021 iGEM wiki employs all modern web design principles that you would expect to see
    on top of being completed catered toward iGEM's MediaWiki environment to be not only fast but accessible.

  <h2>Content-First Design</h2>
  <p>
    A core philosophy we had early with the wiki's design is that above all else, the core focus would be the content
    and the accessibility of that content on as many devices as possible. Given the complexity and wide variety of
    content that is on the wiki, this was certainly a challenge. To focus on the importance of our content, our wiki was
    designed to be as responsive and smooth as possible on everything from desktop devices to tablets to even mobile
    phones. Through extensive user-testing as well as trial and error, we believe that we meet that goal.

  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>
    You will notice our wiki has a peculiar navigational menu on the left-hand side compared to most wikis. This is not
    accidental or random. Through user-experience testing, we determined that people were able to more quickly scan and
    identify menu items with a vertical left-handed navigational menu. As a result of this, users can more quickly
    navigate between page.

  <h2>Reference Tooltips</h2>
  <p>
    In a lot of academic papers searching through references can be a tedious chore. One of the key goals we had with
    our wiki was to streamline the process of not only reading our content but also quickly navigating to any one of our
    references. To do this, we developed a dynamic tooltip system to quickly see all information on a particular
    reference and, if applicable, navigate to a reference's website.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, say we wanted to cite the paper
    <em>Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture</em> from the Proceedings of the National
    Academy of Sciences. It's in-text citation will be the following clickable tooltip: <reference identifier="4" />
  </p>
  <p>In addition to the above, all references will be accessible at the bottom a page in the following format:</p>
  <div class="box">
    <bibliography />
  </div>
</section>

  <h2>Glossary Term Tooltips</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes academic jargon can be hard to understand even when you are familiar with the content. If you are not
    familiar with the content, it can be even more difficult. Our wiki aims to be more accessible for people of all
    experience levels by providing simple and easy to use tooltips for frequently used terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, the following term is clickable and provides the description without needing to search for it:
    <span
      class="note tooltip"
      title="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example Term&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; - This is a description about the example term."
      >Example Term</span
    >
  </p>

  <h2>A Guided Tour</h2>
  <p>
    Navigating a large website with daunting amounts of information can be hard. Don't worry, we thought about that with
    our wiki! If you do not know where to go once your are finished with a page fret not! At the bottom of every page we
    have included an "Explore Next" section which will recommended where to go in our wiki next. Depending on what you
    want, multiple options will be recommended that logical carry forward from the page you left off!
  </p>
  <p>So, when you are ready, start exploring! We hope you enjoy Miami University's first iGEM wiki!</p>
