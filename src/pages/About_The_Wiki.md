# About the Wiki

One of the early goals we set out to accomplish was to develop an intuitive wiki experience catered towards all experience levels and employed cutting edge web design principles. We did not want to just improve on the designs of other wikis; instead, we wanted to build our wiki from the ground up and create something to not only house all of our content for future iGEM teams, but to provide an engaging educational experience. The wiki you see now is the product of months of design, iteration, and dedication; it's something we as the Miami University iGEM team are remarkably proud to call ours.

## Content-First Design

A core philosophy we had early with the wiki's design is that above all else, the core focus would be the content and the accessibility of that content on as many devices as possible. Given the complexity and wide variety of content that is on the wiki, this was certainly a challenge. To focus on the importance of our content, our wiki was designed to be as responsive and smooth as possible on everything from desktop devices to tablets to even mobile phones. Through extensive user-testing as well as trial and error, we believe that we meet that goal. 

## Navigation

You will notice our wiki has a peculiar navigational menu on the left-hand side compared to most wikis. This is not accidental or random. Through user-experience testing, we determined that people were able to more quickly scan and identify menu items with a vertical left-handed navigational menu. As a result of this, users can more quickly navigate between page.

## Reference Tooltips

In a lot of academic papers searching through references can be a tedious chore. One of the key goals we had with our wiki was to streamline the process of not only reading our content but also quickly navigating to any one of our references. To do this, we developed a dynamic tooltip system to quickly see all information on a particular reference and, if applicable, navigate to a reference's website.

For instance, say we wanted to cite the paper _Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture_ from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It's in-text citation will be the following clickable tooltip: <reference identifier="4" />

In addition to the above, all references will be accessible at the bottom a page in the following format:

<div class="box">
  <bibliography />
</div>

## Glossary Term Tooltips

Sometimes academic jargon can be hard to understand even when you are familiar with the content. If you are not familiar with the content, it can be even more difficult. Our wiki aims to be more accessible for people of all experience levels by providing simple and easy to use tooltips for frequently used terms.

For instance, the following term is clickable and provides the description without needing to search for it: <span class="note tooltip" title="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example Term&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; - This is a description about the example term.">Example Term</span>

## A Guided Tour

Navigating a large website with daunting amounts of information can be hard. Don't worry, we thought about that with our wiki! If you do not know where to go once your are finished with a page fret not! At the bottom of every page we have included an "Explore Next" section which will recommended where to go in our wiki next. Depending on what you want, multiple options will be recommended that logical carry forward from the page you left off!

So, when you are ready, start exploring! We hope you enjoy Miami University's first iGEM wiki!
