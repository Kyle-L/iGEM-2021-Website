  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Miami University irregularly offers synthetic biology as the subject focus for an advanced Topics in Microbiology
    course, but the subject matter of this course varies. Due to the variable nature of this course, its materials are
    not available online. Recently, the course focused on synthetic biology when taught by our team PI, Dr. Xin Wang,
    but the course had no direct connection to iGEM (write some stuff about this course material serving as an
    inspiration to start the iGEM project? Hope help). Although none of our team members were enrolled in the course
    during the iGEM competition, this competition did inspire several of us to embrace an interest in synthetic biology.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team began brainstorming and recruiting in April, with the first full team meeting taking place on May 4th. Work
    on the project began immediately after, with a clear focus on photosynthesis improvement by targeting the Calvin
    cycle. Initially, the majority of project work focused on metabolic research and computational modeling to determine
    the most feasible redesign for RuBP regeneration. Labwork began July 28.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team is extremely thankful for the guidance and generosity of the Wang Microbiology Lab, who not only allowed
    our team to use their lab space, cyanobacteria strains, and lab materials, but consistently provided their advice,
    skills, and time. We would also like to acknowledge Dr. Luis Actis, who provided project support and advice.
  </p>
  <p>
    [some statement about how thanks to the contributions of our team members and the members of the lab, we were able
    to accomplish xyz. Also perhaps emphasize that all of our work was internally accomplished.]

  <h2>Team Attributions</h2>
  <h3>Computational Modeling</h3>
  <p>
    Nhu edited all models used in our project. These models were based off of Jared Broderick's model for PCC 7942
    (2016, do link to this).
  </p>
  <p>Hope edited and created the scripts to run flux analysis and growth analysis.</p>
  <h3>Project Design</h3>
  <p>N/A</p>
  <h3>Wet Lab</h3>
  <p>Daria Perminova, Avery Imes and Hope Kirby all contributed to laboratory work.</p>
  <p>
    All three contributed to the initial work creating the genetically altered cyanobacterial strains. Hope and Avery
    oversaw the initial Gibson assembly, amplification of plasmids in <em>E. coli</em> and isolation of the vectors.
    Daria and Avery then finished the transformation into cyanobacteria lines, using segregation and antibiotic
    selection techniques to push the multi-copy genome toward complete transformation.
  </p>
  <p>Daria handled the sequencing analysis and verification of transformant cell lines.</p>
  <p>
    These efforts were greatly assisted by the graduate students of the Wang Lab, Shrameeta Shinde and Shaun Jiang.
    Shrameeta taught our team members relevant skills such as making media or purifying plasmids from gels, as well as
    providing some of the background work such as making the initial antibiotic plates used for transformant selection.
    Shaun supervised much of the lab work.
  </p>
  <h3>Wiki</h3>
  <p>
    As the primary deliverable, the wiki was consequently a joint effort between the entire Miami University iGEM team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kyle Lierer served as the lead developer and designer of the wiki. He was responsible for the following: designing
    the wiki's overall appearance and interactable content; developing a continuous integration and continuous
    deployment pipeline to simplify wiki updates; developing tools to convert Word documents and Markdown files to
    individual wiki pages; developing tools to automatically add references and definition tooltips to the wiki;
    designed and edited all of the wiki specific graphics including the logo; finalized and made edits to all page
    content; helped coordinate wiki deliverable due dates and goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rhonda Krehbiel served as the wiki's lead editor. Everything on the wiki was extensively proofread and edited by
    her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Avery Imes served as the wiki's lead coordinator. She was responsible for making sure that all content needed for
    the wiki was finished and appropriately formatted so that Kyle and Rhonda had time to edit and finalize the wiki
    pages.
  </p>
  <p>...Individual page attributions will go here...</p>
  <p>Hope and Nicholas wrote the computational modeling page content.</p>
  <h3>Collaboration &amp; Outreach</h3>
  <p>Hope Kirby was the link between our team and the Madrid_UCM iGEM team.</p>
  <p>Daria Perminova presented our project progress at the Wright State Science Symposium.</p>
  <h3>Promotional Video</h3>
  <p>
    Avery Imes and Kyle Lierer served as the primary contributors to the project's promotional video. Working together,
    they crafted our two-minute promotional video featured on the wiki's homepage.
  </p>
  <p>Avery Imes is responsible for the voiceover as well as providing key points brought up in the video.</p>
  <p>Kyle Lierer served as the script writer and video editor.</p>
