  <h2>Collaboration with the Complutense University of Madrid</h2>

    Cyanobacteria hold great promise for future biotechnology applications, whether modeling photosynthesis improvements
    or functioning in biofuel production.
  </p>
  <p>
    While our team tackled modeling photosynthesis improvements, the iGEM team from the Complutense University of Madrid
    (<a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:MADRID_UCM">Madrid_UCM</a>) addressed functioning in biofuel production in
    their project 4C_Fuels; this team aimed to stimulate n-butinol production in cyanobacteria through synthetic
    pathways suggested in previously published literature. Similarly to the techniques of our team, they planned to use
    integrative plasmids to introduce a synthetic pathway, changing the metabolism of the host cyanobacteria to suit
    their engineering goals. To enhance this butinol production, the team also planned to introduce a modified
    malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) carbon fixation pathway; this pathway enhances production of acetyl-CoA to fuel butinol
    production, but also impacts photosynthetic output. Miamis iGEM team applied Madrids modified pathway to our
    computational model to assess metabolic flux levels and biomass formation.
  </p>
  <h3>Details of Collaboration</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the potential advantage their modified MCG pathway may have on photosynthetic output, we applied their
    modified pathway to the metabolism of PCC7942 based model to assess flux levels and biomass formation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We will include this pathway alone combined with our own synthetic pathways which potentially allow a more robust
      regeneration of RuBP.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will also assess the production of n-butinol with and without this modified MCG pathway to assess if its use
      for acetyl-CoA production can potentially be linked to n-butinol production based on their combined pathways.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Waiting for findings</p>

  <h2>Science Symposium: Hosted by Wright State University</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> The Wright State University iGEM team
    (WrightState) hosted a virtual 2021 Science Symposium on August 12th, which was attended by iGEM teams from the host
    team, The Ohio State University (OhioState), University of Virginia (Virginia), and Miami University. Each team gave
    a short presentation on their project. This event provided an opportunity for engagement as well as collaboration by
    allowing team members to ask questions and give advice on navigating the challenges of an iGEM project. The veteran
    teams gave excellent advice on time management, organization of wiki content creation, and adapting supply delays
    and lab limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was an excellent opportunity to learn about other
    projects and make connections with other iGEM teams, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic limiting opportunities
    for in-person interaction.
