    Collaboration with
    <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:MADRID_UCM">4C_Fuels</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Cyanobacteria hold great promise for future biotechnology applications,
    whether modeling photosynthesis improvements or functioning in biofuel
    production. With our team tackling the first aspect, the Madrid_UCM team
    addressed the second in their project 4C_Fuels; this team aimed to stimulate
    n-butinol production in cyanobacteria through synthetic pathways suggested
    in previously published literature. Similarly to the techniques of our team,
    they planned to use integrative plasmids to introduce a synthetic pathway,
    changing the metabolism of the host cyanobacteria to suit their engineering
    goals. To enhance this butinol production, the team also planned to
    introduce a modified malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) carbon fixation pathway; this
    pathway enhances production of acetyl-CoA to fuel butinol production, but
    also impacts photosynthetic output. Miamis iGEM team applied Madrids
    modified pathway to our computational model to assess metabolic flux levels
    and biomass formation.

  <h3>Details of Collaboration</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the potential advantage their modified MCG pathway may have on
    photosynthetic output, we applied their modified pathway to the metabolism
    of PCC7942 based model to assess flux levels and biomass formation.

  <ul>
    <li>
      We will include this pathway alone combined with our own synthetic
      pathways which potentially allow a more robust regeneration of RuBP.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will also assess the production of n-butinol with and without this
      modified MCG pathway to assess if its use for acetyl-CoA production can
      potentially be linked to n-butinol production based on their combined
      pathways.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Waiting for findings</p>

  <h2>
    Science Symposium: Hosted by
    <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:WrightState">WrightState</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The WrightState iGEM team hosted a virtual 2021 Science Symposium on August
    12th, which was attended by iGEM teams from the Ohio State University, the
    University of Virginia, Miami University along with our hosts team. Each
    team gave a short presentation on their project. This event provided an
    opportunity for engagement and collaboration, allowing team members to ask
    questions and give advice on navigating the challenges of an iGEM project.
    The veteran teams gave excellent advice on time management, organization of
    wiki content creation, and adapting supply delays and lab limitations due to
    COVID-19. This event was an excellent opportunity to learn about other
    projects and make connections with other iGEMers, especially in an era of
    limited opportunity for interaction.
