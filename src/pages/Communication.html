    Our educational efforts focused on two main themes. First, we wanted to address the fact that genetically modified
    organisms (GMOs) are a controversial topic. There are valid concerns raised about GMO technology, but some concerns
    are driven by fear and misinformation. Therefore, our goal was to contribute to the creation of factual GMO
    information resources and interactive discussion to build trust. We aimed to establish a scientifically solid
    foundation with which our community can approach their own future encounters with and analysis of GMO information.

    Second, we wanted to produce accessible education on photosynthesis that extends beyond the oversimplified reactions
    that are commonly taught. The limits of photosynthesis are becoming a major component of the research into
    increasing crop yield, so the first step into understanding that research is to understand photosynthetic reactions.
    Instilling accurate scientific information into the younger generation’s education is key for their ability to
    address the rising concern of food insecurity in the future.
  </p>
  <p>In total, our education work amounted to three distinct projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A presentation and discussion on advancing GMO technology at a local older adult care facility.</li>
    <li>
      An interactive video and activity materials that introduce elementary aged children to GMOs. This video was
      distributed throughout our local school district and to the education department of our university’s natural
      history museum.
    </li>
    <li>
      An article written for the open source scientific journal <em>Frontiers for Young Minds</em> on photosynthesis
      titled, “How Does Photosynthesis Wake Up?”
    </li>
  </ul>
