  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <div class="box">
    Global agricultural productivity is projected to require major increases within the next century to meet the needs
    of our increasing population. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis. Our
    project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration
    portion of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other metabolic
    reactions acting on common metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling.
    Impacts on growth and reaction fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust
    photosynthetic cycle. One of these pathways, which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed
    in vivo. Ultimately, we showed the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration
    stage of the CBB cycle. These pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust
    cycling and therefore higher crop yield.

    Global demand for crop production is expected to increase by 100% from 2005 levels by 2050
    <reference identifier="4" />. We depend on high agricultural productivity for numerous needs; not only must crop
    production fulfill the direct requirements for human and livestock food consumption, but it must also fuel the needs
    of a growing bioeconomy that demands bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals <reference identifier="3" />. Despite the
    rising demand, production is threatened by a variety of factors. This problem is accentuated by land limitations, as
    available crop areas shrink and land demand clashes with environmental protection and sustainability goals
    <reference identifier="3" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly inspired by the aims of the <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE project</a>, our project uses the
    application of synthetic biology tools to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. By improving photosynthesis,
    yield improves at the level of individual crops, amounting to a greater harvest yield without increased land usage.
    Specifically, our project targets a major inefficiency within the RuBP regeneration portion of the CBB cycle. The
    CBB cycle is the portion of photosynthesis responsible for carbon fixation. Carbon fixation, which converts carbon
    dioxide into the usable organic forms that plants use to grow, is a key determinant of crop production at the
    cellular level.

    The CBB cycle is dependent on the continuous cycling of its intermediates. Many of these intermediates, however, can
    be consumed by other metabolic reactions, depleting the CBB cycle of its required compounds. The CBB cycle stalls
    until the missing intermediates can be replenished. This constant pausing culminates into major growth loss over the
    course of the growing season for a plant. By limiting the number of intermediates, however, there is less potential
    for other reactions to ‘steal’ these metabolites and thus drain the available pool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our project aims to reduce the number of intermediates in the CBB cycle by implementing an alternative RuBP
    regeneration pathway. This results in a more continuous CBB cycle that allows for more carbon to be fixed in a given
    timeframe, therefore improving growth yield.
  </p>
  <p>
    We proposed two alternative pathways. Our first alternative pathway involves the use of the synthetic enzyme
    fructose-6-phosphate aldolase to truncate the native eight-enzyme pathway to one only reliant on three enzymes,
    thereby decreasing intermediate loss and enzymatic cost. Our second alternative pathway utilizes the native enzyme
    transaldolase to circumvent the use of another photosynthetic enzyme, once again decreasing the need for specific
    intermediates hypothesized to limit the photosynthetic cycle. Both alternative pathways were first simulated via
    computational modeling to predict the viability of the pathway and explore potential wet lab considerations. Due to
    the transaldolase pathway overexpressing a native enzyme rather than a synthetic set as observed with the first,
    this transaldolase pathway was evaluated in vivo using the cyanobacterial strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942</i>.
    Cyanobacteria are generally considered an ideal model organism for exploration of and genetic manipulation of
    photosynthesis due to their malleable genome, homogenous population when cultivated, and rapid growth rate
    <reference identifier="4" />.

  <p>
    Our work could be integrated into similar systems in crop plants to increase yields, contributing to global food
    sustainability for the growing population.
  </p>
  <p>
    For our project, we also developed significant education and communication efforts with our community. We approached
    this outreach with two main goals. First, we wanted to address the concept of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
    as a controversial topic, in which information is often shrouded by paranoia and unscientific claims for the general
    public. Due to the vital role of GMO crops in future applications of our project, we aimed to educate groups who had
    limited opportunities to accurately learn about GMOs. We focused on two groups we believed were most susceptible to
    impact by unreliable sources; elementary age children and senior citizens. Second, we wanted to produce accurate
    educational content on the complexities of photosynthesis. In many education systems, photosynthesis is limited to
    “light” and “dark” reactions, a massive oversimplification of the foundational source of biological energy in our
    world. With the limitations of photosynthesis becoming a rising research focus, we wanted to alleviate the early
    miseducation and misconceptions children are often exposed to regarding photosynthesis. Thus, we aimed to generate
    significant material to educate rising generations on photosynthesis, its limits, and its importance in research.
