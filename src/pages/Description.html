    <p>Global agricultural productivity must double by 2050 to meet the rising demand fueled by an
      increasing population developing higher standards of living <a href="#reference-1">[1]</a>. On a cellular level,
      crop yield is limited by the
      inefficiency of photosynthesis; the maximal energy conversion observed in plants has been less than 4% <a
        href="#reference-2">[2]</a>. Our
      project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative regeneration portion of the Calvin cycle.
      Alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other metabolic reactions that act on common metabolites used in the
      Calvin cycle, were first explored via computational modeling. The most promising of these pathways, which
      eliminates
      the enzyme SBPase and overexpresses transaldolase, was then demonstrated in vivo. By overexpressing transaldolase,
      a
      more continuous and robust pathway for the Calvin cycle can be generated. [insert sentence for what our results
      actually are and that we basically hope it will improve growth rate or yield, which can be implemented into higher
      plants such as crops to increase crop yield per plant].

  <h2 id="content" class="fadeMe">Project Description</h2>
  <p class="fadeMe">Global demand for crop production is expected to increase by 100% from 2005 levels by 2050 <a
      href="#reference-1">[1]</a>. We
    depend on high agricultural productivity to fulfill numerous needs. Not only must crop production meet the direct
    requirements for human and livestock food consumption, but it must also fuel the needs of a growing bioeconomy that
    demands bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals <a href="#reference-3">[3]</a>. Despite the rising demand, production is
    threatened by a variety of
    factors. </p>
  <p class="fadeMe"><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>Similarly inspired by
    the aims of the <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE project</a>, our
    project uses the
    application of synthetic biology tools to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. By improving photosynthesis,
    yield improves at the level of individual crops, amounting to a greater harvest yield without increased land usage.
    Specifically, our project targets a major inefficiency within the RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin cycle. The
    Calvin cycle is the portion of photosynthesis responsible for carbon fixation. Carbon fixation, which converts
    carbon dioxide into the usable organic forms that plants use to grow, is a key determinant of crop production at the
    cellular level. </p>
  <p class="fadeMe">The Calvin cycle is dependent on the continuous cycling of its intermediates. Many of these
    intermediates, however, can be consumed by other metabolic reactions, thus depleting the Calvin cycle of its
    required compounds. Without these compounds, the Calvin cycle stalls until the missing intermediates can be
    replenished. This constant pausing builds into major growth loss over the course of the growing season for a plant.
    By limiting the number of intermediates, however, there is less potential for other reactions to 'steal' these
    metabolites and thus drain the available pool. </p>
  <p class="fadeMe"><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our project aims to
    reduce the number of intermediates in the Calvin cycle by implementing an
    alternative RuBP regeneration pathway. The enzyme transaldolase, which is able to convert (the compounds to the
    compounds), reduces the number of intermediates that can leave the cycle for other pathways. This results in a more
    continuous Calvin cycle that allows for more carbon to be fixed in a given timeframe, therefore improving growth
    yield. </p>
  <p class="fadeMe">This alternative pathway was first simulated via computational modeling in order to predict the
    viability of the pathway and explore potential ideal expression levels. The pathway was then explored in a
    laboratory setting using the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Cyanobacteria are generally
    considered an ideal model organism for exploration of and genetic manipulation of photosynthesis due to their
    malleable genome, homogenous population when cultivated, and rapid growth rate <a href="#reference-1">[1]</a>.
  <p class="fadeMe">Our work could be integrated into the similar systems of crop plants to increase yields,
    contributing to global food sustainability for the growing population.</p>
