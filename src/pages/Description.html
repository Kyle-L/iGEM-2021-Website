    <p>
      Global agricultural productivity must double by 2050 to meet the rising
      demand fueled by an increasing population developing higher standards of
      living <a href="#reference-1">(1)</a>. On a cellular level, crop yield is
      limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis; the maximal energy
      conversion observed in plants has been less than 4%
      <a href="#reference-2">(2)</a>. Our project aims to improve this
      efficiency by implementing an alternative regeneration portion of the
      Calvin cycle. Alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other metabolic
      reactions that act on common metabolites used in the Calvin cycle, were
      first explored via computational modeling. The most promising of these
      pathways, which eliminates the enzyme SBPase and overexpresses
      transaldolase, was then demonstrated in vivo. By overexpressing
      transaldolase, a more continuous and robust pathway for the Calvin cycle
      can be generated. [insert sentence for what our results actually are and
      that we basically hope it will improve growth rate or yield, which can be
      implemented into higher plants such as crops to increase crop yield per
      plant].

    >Global demand for crop production is expected to increase by 100% from 2005
    levels by 2050 <a href="#reference-1">(1)</a>. We depend on high
    agricultural productivity to fulfill numerous needs. Not only must crop
    production meet the direct requirements for human and livestock food
    consumption, but it must also fuel the needs of a growing bioeconomy that
    demands bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals <a href="#reference-3">(3)</a>.
    Despite the rising demand, production is threatened by a variety of factors.

  <p class="fadeMe">
    Similarly inspired by the aims of the
    <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE project</a>, our project uses the
    application of synthetic biology tools to improve the efficiency of
    photosynthesis. By improving photosynthesis, yield improves at the level of
    individual crops, amounting to a greater harvest yield without increased
    land usage. Specifically, our project targets a major inefficiency within
    the RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle is the
    portion of photosynthesis responsible for carbon fixation. Carbon fixation,
    which converts carbon dioxide into the usable organic forms that plants use
    to grow, is a key determinant of crop production at the cellular level.

    >The Calvin cycle is dependent on the continuous cycling of its
    intermediates. Many of these intermediates, however, can be consumed by
    other metabolic reactions, thus depleting the Calvin cycle of its required
    compounds. Without these compounds, the Calvin cycle stalls until the
    missing intermediates can be replenished. This constant pausing builds into
    major growth loss over the course of the growing season for a plant. By
    limiting the number of intermediates, however, there is less potential for
    other reactions to 'steal' these metabolites and thus drain the available
    pool.
  </p>
  <p class="fadeMe">
    Our project aims to reduce the number of intermediates in the Calvin cycle
    by implementing an alternative RuBP regeneration pathway. The enzyme
    transaldolase, which is able to convert (the compounds to the compounds),
    reduces the number of intermediates that can leave the cycle for other
    pathways. This results in a more continuous Calvin cycle that allows for
    more carbon to be fixed in a given timeframe, therefore improving growth
    yield.
  </p>
  <p class="fadeMe">
    This alternative pathway was first simulated via computational modeling in
    order to predict the viability of the pathway and explore potential ideal
    expression levels. The pathway was then explored in a laboratory setting
    using the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.
    Cyanobacteria are generally considered an ideal model organism for
    exploration of and genetic manipulation of photosynthesis due to their
    malleable genome, homogenous population when cultivated, and rapid growth
    rate <a href="#reference-1">(1)</a>.

  <p class="fadeMe">
    Our work could be integrated into the similar systems of crop plants to
    increase yields, contributing to global food sustainability for the growing
    population.
