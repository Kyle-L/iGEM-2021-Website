  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <div class="box">
    Global agricultural productivity is projected to not meet the needs of increasing populations developing higher
    standards of living. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis. Our project
    aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative regeneration portion of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
    (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other metabolic reactions that act on common
    metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling. Impacts on growth and reaction
    fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust photosynthetic cycle. One of
    these pathways which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed in vivo. Ultimately, we showed
    the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration stage of the CBB Cycle. These
    pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust cycling and therefore higher crop
    yield.

    Global demand for crop production is expected to increase by 100% from 2005 levels by 2050
    <reference identifier="4" />. We depend on high agricultural productivity to fulfill numerous needs. Not only must
    crop production meet the direct requirements for human and livestock food consumption, but it must also fuel the
    needs of a growing bioeconomy that demands bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals <reference identifier="3" />. Despite
    the rising demand, production is threatened by a variety of factors. This problem is accentuated by land
    limitations, as available crop areas shrink and land demand clashes with environmental protection and sustainability
    requirements <reference identifier="3" />.

    Similarly inspired by the aims of the <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE project</a>, our project uses the
    application of synthetic biology tools to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. By improving photosynthesis,
    yield improves at the level of individual crops, amounting to a greater harvest yield without increased land usage.
    Specifically, our project targets a major inefficiency within the RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin cycle. The
    Calvin cycle is the portion of photosynthesis responsible for carbon fixation. Carbon fixation, which converts
    carbon dioxide into the usable organic forms that plants use to grow, is a key determinant of crop production at the
    cellular level.

    The Calvin cycle is dependent on the continuous cycling of its intermediates. Many of these intermediates, however,
    can be consumed by other metabolic reactions, thus depleting the Calvin cycle of its required compounds. Without
    these compounds, the Calvin cycle stalls until the missing intermediates can be replenished. This constant pausing
    builds into major growth loss over the course of the growing season for a plant. By limiting the number of
    intermediates, however, there is less potential for other reactions to ‘steal’ these metabolites and thus drain the
    available pool. Our project aims to reduce the number of intermediates in the Calvin cycle by implementing an
    alternative RuBP regeneration pathway. The enzyme transaldolase, which is able to convert (the compounds to the
    compounds), reduces the number of intermediates that can leave the cycle for other pathways. This results in a more
    continuous Calvin cycle that allows for more carbon to be fixed in a given timeframe, therefore improving growth
    yield.

    This alternative pathway was first simulated via computational modeling in order to predict the viability of the
    pathway and explore potential ideal expression levels. The pathway was then explored in a laboratory setting using
    the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Cyanobacteria are generally considered an ideal model
    organism for exploration of and genetic manipulation of photosynthesis due to their malleable genome, homogenous
    population when cultivated, and rapid growth rate <reference identifier="4" />. Our work could be integrated into
    the similar systems of crop plants to increase yields, contributing to global food sustainability for the growing
    population.
