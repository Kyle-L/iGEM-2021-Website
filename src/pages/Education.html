  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>
    Our educational efforts focused on two main themes. First, we wanted to address that genetically modified organisms
    (GMOs) are a controversial topic, addressing both valid concerns about abuse of the technology while correcting fear
    driven by misinformation. Therefore, our goal was to contribute to the creation of accurate GMO information
    resources, and to introduce that content in a manner that builds trust between the public and the scientific
    community. We aimed to empower our community to be confident in their knowledge and better approach future
    interactions with potentially inaccurate information. We did this by creating materials for two age groups: older
    adults and elementary school aged children.
  </p>

    Second, we wanted to produce accessible education on photosynthesis that extends beyond the oversimplified reactions
    that are commonly taught. From childhood to even some introductory higher education courses, photosynthesis is often
    simplified to the “light and dark reactions.” This description has become completely outdated, and even incorrect,
    with current knowledge. Inaccurate, oversimplification of photosynthesis is no ground to begin public– and potential
    future scientists’– view of the basis of all biological energy. The limits of photosynthesis are becoming a large
    part of the research into increasing crop yield, and the first step of building interest and passion for that
    research is understanding photosynthesis reactions. Instilling accurate scientific information into the younger
    generation’s education is also key for their ability to address the rising concern of food insecurity in the future.

      Our presentation’s audience was the residents of the Knolls of Oxford in Oxford, OH. The residents of the Knolls
      have varying levels of mobility, so we decided to use a
      <a href="#downloads-knolls">presentation</a> (downloadable below) to convey our information; a presentation is
      easily adaptable to different accessibility aids. The presentation shared information about what GMOs are, how
      they are made, and notable examples of GMO technology. Before the presentation began, we passed out notecards to
      residents for the residents to write down any questions. If a resident was not comfortable asking a question, or
      if they had a question after the presentation was over, they could write their question on the card. Residents
      were also free to ask any questions during the presentation. We then collected all notecards and used
      them to guide the creation of a pamphlet. The pamphlet goes over what we discussed in our presentation, some good
      sources for further understanding, and answers their common questions. After its creation, the pamphlet was
      delivered to the Knolls to be distributed to the residents. It also serves a tangible resource that they can refer
      back to and share with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our audience members had a variety of backgrounds, some from scientific fields and some not. By having an
      interdisciplinary discussion, we were able to gain insight on how older generations think about GMOs from a
      variety of perspectives. Residents built upon each other’s ideas and we were able to have a collaborative and
      insightful conversation. To read further about this discussion, see our
      <a href="/Human_Practices">Human Practices</a> page.

      We reached out to many educators who were excited to share and discuss GMOs with their classes. Knowing that there
      were still many COVID-19 related restrictions in place for in-person events, we opted to create an interactive
      video on the creation of GMOs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave our video to the head of our local school district’s Science department as well as to our university’s
      natural history museum. Julie Robinson, Director of Environmental Education at Miami’s Hefner Museum of Natural
      History wrote back to us after reviewing our video. She was grateful for the resource and she emphasized the
      importance of flexible online educational opportunities:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Virtual learning offers an instructional environment that is accessible and flexible for students and teachers.
      While virtual education is continually changing in its content and context, it is essential that we recognize its
      support to the traditional classroom setting, especially to the STEM related fields of study. By providing
      factual, rigorous, and engaging science e-learning experiences beyond the traditional school day or classroom,
      educators and students gain access to the world through discovery and synthesis. Such experiences foster a
      knowledge of the value of science fields through project-based initiatives and increased opportunities to exercise
      applicable skills not readily available in the conventional setting.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Even though we chose to pursue an online and asynchronous format, we still made our video interactive. In order to
      explain how a GMO is made, we created a
      <a href="#downloads-plasmid">paper cutting activity</a> (downloadable below) to demonstrate how a gene is inserted
      into plasmids. The educators were provided with a printable version of the activity while the video has step by
      step instructions to facilitate the video.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students would be given a colored paper circle to represent a plasmid. They would then be able to cut part of the
      circle out to symbolize the nick in DNA required to insert new DNA. Then, using another color they would need to
      cut a shape to fill the created gap. This represents taking DNA from one organism and putting it into the DNA of
      another, creating a simplified version of a genetically modified organism! By creating their own genetically
      modified organism the students gain a hands-on learning experience. This activity allows children themselves to go
      through the process of creating a GMO at the most basic level, introducing them to how DNA is actually taken from
      one organism and put into the genome of another. From this starting point, students can expand their knowledge on
      GMO creation into more complex levels as their science education progresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we were distributing these materials to educators, we ensured that we took into consideration the education
      standards of the
      <a href="http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Science/Ohios-Learning-Standards-and-MC"
        >Ohio Department of Education</a
      >
      (ODE) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). For ODE, the video most clearly fulfills Designing
      technological/engineering solutions using scientific concepts - Technology and Engineering. The focused audience
      is Grades 4-6. For NGSS, the video particularly addresses Appendix F of “Science and Engineering Practices” by
      providing actual interactive activities by which students can construct explanations of the problem, and design
      solutions for said problem.

  <h2>Photosynthesis: Frontiers Article</h2>
  <p>
    We also wrote an article to communicate the more complex, but highly applicable recent discoveries involving the
    limitations of photosynthesis. Specifically, we summarized the findings of an article published by our primary
    investigator, Dr. Xin Wang, and his laboratory on the relationship between photosynthesis and its other metabolisms
    as it transitions from dark to light. This article was targeted at children aged 8-12 and was published in the
    journal Frontiers<em> for Young Minds </em><reference identifier="29" />. This open access journal has experienced
    scientists write about new research in a format accessible to young readers. Articles go through a peer review
    editorial process, specifically with review from a Science Mentor and a young student pair. Our article is currently
    titled “How does Photosynthesis Wake Up?” and is in the submission process, expected to be published within the next
    few months.
