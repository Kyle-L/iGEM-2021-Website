    Communities throughout the world struggle to meet daily nutritional needs. Areas such as the Middle East, North
    Africa and South Asia are often affected most, with a severe margin of undernourishment and the majority of
    countries in this region not on track to reduce undernourishment (Figure 1). As the human population continues to
    grow, food production has not risen to match pace; food availability is simultaneously threatened by cultivable land
    limitations and the increasing use of food crops for fuel sources. Food production is rapidly coming under a higher
    demand than it can sustain at current productivity levels <reference identifier="3" />. With no feasible way to
    increase the amount of land under cultivation, the only option that remains is to increase the actual productive
    yield of what crops are currently being cultivated. One solution is to improve crop yield by optimizing the process
    of photosynthesis, the incorporation of light energy into sugar molecules. Our project aims to design genetic
    systems in cyanobacteria that drive forward RuBP regeneration. A more robust RuBP regeneration pathway results in
    more continuous RuBP regeneration, meaning photosynthesis is stalled less often. The more continuous the
    photosynthesis, the better a cell can grow. Biomass production becomes more efficient at a cellular level when the
    efficiency of this metabolic process is increased. The technology demonstrated by our group in the model
    photosynthesizer cyanobacteria can then be applied to crop plants, boosting crop yield per plant.

  <h2>Proposed Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    We envision that our technology will be used by plant biologists and other researchers interested in improving
    photosynthetic efficiency. The resulting crop varieties could be cultivated by growers on a global scale, increasing
    crop production while decreasing agricultural land usage and maintaining the same labor requirements.

    Through well developed and documented procedures for genetic engineering in plants, we anticipate that our
    cyanobacterial over-expression and deletion systems will be translated into common crop varieties. The real
    application of our technology is in the development of agricultural productivity to sustain the dietary needs of a
    growing human population. This mission is already being reflected in a current international project called
    Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency, or <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE</a>
    <reference identifier="24" />. The crop varieties targeted within the
    <a href="https://ripe.illinois.edu">RIPE</a> project are cassava, cowpea, maize, rice and soybean
    <reference identifier="24" />. Within the agricultural industry, a shift has already begun toward genetically
    engineered plants.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plant genetics has advanced from simply selecting and breeding individuals with desired characteristics. Now
    researchers can directly introduce genes for pest resistance, drought resistance, and improved flavor and
    nutritional content <reference identifier="25" />. A major challenge is the shift from genetic engineering of
    highly specialized prokaryotic cyanobacteria to complex multicellular plants. However, several methods for plant
    genetic engineering have already been developed and in use for decades. One approach is the integration of transfer
    DNA (T-DNA) mediated by <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em>. This bacterium typically infects wound sites in plants
    to cause gall growth deformities, but this mechanism of infection has been exploited to transfer DNA to plant cells
    for genetic engineering. Similarly, another method includes collecting embryogenic cells and co-culturing
    them with <em>A. tumefaciens</em>; this method provides the advantage of early stage selection so that all cells of
    the adult plant can be confirmed to have the desired genetic changes <reference identifier="21" />. Projects that
    use a multigene approach to stimulate electron transport and carbon regeneration in plants may have already provided
    a direction for incorporating our research <reference identifier="26" />. Technological advances can provide even
    more options for gene editing, such as the widely renowned CRISPR-Cas9 system.
  </p>
  <p>
    This path to agricultural improvement is widely acknowledged across the globe. Research facilities around the world
    collaborate to target specific areas in the 170-step photosynthetic process to make improvements where it is
    feasible
    <reference identifier="24" />. Considering the extensive community that shares our vision of optimizing plant
    productivity, we want our work to contribute to this crucial movement. Overall, we are driven by the idea that
    without an increase in crop yields, we will not be able to sustain the human population.

    Overexpression of our target Calvin-Bensen-Bassham (CBB) cycle enzymes, transaldolase and
    fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase<em>, </em>is not known to lead to the production of toxic by-products. These enzymes are
    already natively expressed in cyanobacteria for their central metabolism; we are only altering the expression levels
    of these enzymes to exploit their ability to manipulate intermediates of the CBB cycle. These enzymes are vital for
    the regular metabolism of photosynthetic organisms, including plants, and are only increasing the concentration at
    which they are present. Therefore, there is not a reasonable risk of toxicity production if implemented into crops.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our computer modeling team also processed a secondary potential pathway, termed the glycolaldehyde pathway. 
    This pathway, detailed within the modeling page, utilizes an enzyme found in <iEscherichia coli> and a reaction 
    with no identified enzyme yet. If not found in nature, it is likely that this enzyme can be generated through 
    directed evolution experiments. Due to the time constraint to evolve such an enzyme in labs, we only tested this 
    pathway through computational modeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the main safety considerations stem from the consequences of genetic manipulation. We do not intend our
    genetically engineered cyanobacteria to be directly used in a practical setting. However, because we envision that
    the technology will be used in crop plants, there are specific national regulations and protocols that apply. We can
    expect that implementation of our overexpression and deletion systems in plants requires years of indisputable
    research and evidence of its safety for consumption. High scrutiny and care is necessary because genetically
    modified organisms (GMOs) raise concerns regarding their potential impact on the environment and human health, and
    any other unintended effects of transgene introduction <reference identifier="22" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the direct product of our target enzymes are nontoxic, it is important that we understand the secondary
    consequences of gene overexpression on metabolic flow. This is a common focus in genetic engineering, and is
    addressed by our modeling experiments. However, plants might respond differently to excess metabolite production
    than our single-celled prokaryote, which would require additional screening methods in future research.

  <h2>Other Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    In order for our results to translate into practical use in crop plants, we must first clearly demonstrate that our
    system works in cyanobacteria and explain why we expect it to apply to higher plants.

    Another consideration with the incorporation of our system in plants involves choosing the right crops and genetic
    engineering methods that will optimize safety and efficiency in implementing our project into crops. Although this
    downstream analysis of safety is beyond the scope of our project, which instead focuses on cyanobacteria, it would
    be a vital component in future work. For instance, not all crop plants synthesize sugar molecules in the same
    manner. The CBB cycle we are working with is part of C<sub>3</sub> metabolism. This is in contrast to C<sub>4</sub>
    metabolism seen in crops like maize, sugarcane, and sorghum, which spatially separates Rubisco from oxygen in the
    atmosphere. While work in C<sub>4</sub> plants is exciting due to their already inherently high productivity, we
    must consider that our system only applies to C<sub>3</sub> cultivars such as tobacco, cowpeas, and soybeans.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plant and bacterial differences must be considered; these organisms differ in their photosynthesis methods,
    genetics, and cellular organization. Years of evolutionary divergence might complicate and reduce the efficiency at
    which our system is incorporated into crop plants. Current crop cultivars have experienced years of selective
    breeding and hybridization that has extensively multiplied the chromosome copy number seen in certain species.
    Multiplication of the original haploid genome is known as polyploidy and it is a common occurrence in higher plants.
    Even considering that <em>Synechococcus elongatus </em>PCC 7942 also has multiple copies of its genome, the
    complexity is not as extensive in our single-celled prokaryote as these plants. Secondly, the multicellularity of
    plants requires additional care in ensuring that every cell has incorporated any genetic alterations. Otherwise, we
    can expect a mosaic effect in which only certain cells are overexpressing our target enzymes, which would make our
    system less effective and harder to evaluate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the random insertion of introduced DNA into the plant genome may lead to positional effects in which
    the expression of the transgene is silenced <reference identifier="23" />. This is a characteristic of eukaryotic
    organisms like plants, and increases variability in the results of genetic engineering. This is in part why full
    resequencing and verification of genetically modified food crops is integral to successful use, as only purposeful
    modifications are desired.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, numerous unknowns may also affect future experimentation in plants, and we shall rely on ever-expanding
    scientific knowledge to unravel them. Despite these challenges, we are still confident that our research can support
    growth in plant genetics.
