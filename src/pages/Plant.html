  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    As the population continues to rise, the need for greater crop yield is an issue of increasing concern. This issue
    is compounded by rising need in various sectors; not only is crop biofuel demand increasing as carbon emissions
    rise, but agricultural production is predicted to require drastic increases by 2050 to fulfill nutrition
    requirements of the growing population <reference identifier="42" />. Rising need conflicts with sustainability goals to reduce farmland <reference identifier="43" />.
    These conditions strain the agricultural industry, whose best solution is increasing crop production efficiency at
    the level of individual plants. One issue inhibiting greater production efficiency is the inefficiency of
    photosynthesis, the primary energy source for plants, which studies suggest only converts a maximum of 6% of solar
    energy into energy stored in carbohydrates <reference identifier="44" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although many aspects of photosynthesis do not efficiently convert energy, our team focused on the regenerative
    segment of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. The CBB cycle reactions convert carbon dioxide into organic
    carbon. The regenerative segment of the cycle recycles portions of the carbon compounds into
    ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to allow continuous cycle activity. The major inefficiency of this portion stems
    from the intermediates being consumed in other metabolic processes. Our team selected this portion of the cycle as
    our target for redesign due to a clear solution; if enzymes could be introduced to circumvent some steps, thereby
    reducing the number of intermediates available to leave the cycle, RuBP regeneration efficiency could be increased.
    By increasing RuBP regeneration, growth rate could be improved by creating a more continuous and efficient
    photosynthetic cycle.

    To model plant metabolomics, our group used cyanobacterial strain <em>Synechococcus elongatus</em> PCC 7942 as our
    chassis. Photosynthesis, especially the CBB cycle, is well conserved across photosynthetic organisms. Cyanobacteria
    make an excellent model organism for crop plants for a variety of reasons, particularly due to the ease of genetic
    manipulation compared to eukaryotic organisms <reference identifier="45" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Potential metabolic redesigns for RuBP regeneration were thoroughly investigated via computational modeling. Two
    potential pathways were explored: the transaldolase pathway and the glycolaldehyde pathway. Between these pathways,
    our team proceeded to test the transaldolase pathway in vivo. The fully redesigned pathway requires the deletion of
    <em>glpX</em>, which encodes SBPase, and the addition of <em>tal</em>, encoding transaldolase. SBPase
    dephosphorylates sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) and is present in the
    native CBB cycle (Figure 1). By knocking out SBPase and introducing transaldolase, which converts
    erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to S7P and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), the
    redesigned pathway reduces the number of intermediates that can be consumed in other reactions (Figure 1).
  </p>

  <p>
    SBPase is an essential protein, and therefore cannot be deleted before giving its relevant pathway an alternative.
    To address this issue, our team first induced the overexpression of transaldolase to allow cell survival of SBPase
    deletion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, this reduction of the number of intermediates in the regenerative segment of the CBB cycle allows fewer
    metabolic processes to slow down the regeneration of RuBP by skipping two steps of the CBB cycle.
  </p>

    Our project also significantly focused on educational and dialogue-based outreach in order to give our community a
    scientifically accurate foundation of GMO knowledge, detailed on our
    <a href="/Education">Education page</a>. We targeted two age groups: elementary school children and older adults.
    For the elementary students we created informational resources and interactive games that educators could
    incorporate into their lesson plans, and we distributed those to local schools and a museum. For our outreach to
    older adults, we held a presentation and conversation at our local adult care home. Both of these efforts focused on
    building knowledge for the creation of GMOs. If our community has an accurate understanding of the science of GMOs,
    then discussions about projects like our can go further, and we can create a more educated community.
  </p>

    Our educational components also expanded to photosynthesis as a general process. We submitted a manuscript on the
    light to dark transition in photosynthesis for the Frontiers for Young Minds journal, linked on the
    <a href="/Education">Education page</a>, describing research accomplished using genetic modification and providing
    open access material on photosynthetic complexity.

  <h2>Our Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    Our team was able to successfully model our alternative pathway and generate predictive results of how these
    redesigned pathways would affect cell physiology and biomass generation, detailed on our
    <a href="/Model">Computational Modeling page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> </strong>Our team also expanded the iGEM Part’s Registry in terms of cyanobacterial parts, submitting 40
    parts described on our <a href="/Contribution">Contributions</a> and <a href="/Parts">Parts</a> pages, incorporated
    into our 4 plasmids. We were able to achieve successful transformation with all our plasmids in our photosynthetic
    chassis organism. Due to the multiple genome copies and time restraints of the competition, however, we have not yet
    achieved total segregation for transformants.

    In wet lab, we were able to successfully transform the overexpression genes into the cyanobacteria. Due to SBPase
    being previously established as an essential enzyme, we did have doubts that we would be able to knock it out
    completely. However, there was evidence that it was knocked out of at least a few copies of the genome because the
    strains transformed with the pGEM-SBPase plasmid showed a resistance to antibiotics encoded in the plasmid. We did
    have colonies that were successfully transformed with overexpression genes for transaldolase,
    fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and both genes. The growth experiment results demonstrated that the
    overexpression of FBPase and transaldolase simultaneously was more effective in the regeneration of the CBB cycle
    than overexpression of either alone. Even with overexpression of both, there was less growth than the wild type
    culture. This is likely due to the fact that because the SBPase gene was not knocked out, intermediates from the
    regenerative stage were still able to be used in other metabolic processes (Figure 2).
