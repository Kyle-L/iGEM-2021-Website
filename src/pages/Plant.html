  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    As the population continues to rise, the need for greater crop yield is an issue of increasing concern. This issue
    is compounded by rising need in various sectors; not only is crop biofuel demand increasing as carbon emissions
    rise, but agricultural production is predicted to require drastic increases by 2050 to fulfill nutrition
    requirements of the growing population <reference identifier="42" />. Rising needs conflict with sustainability
    goals to reduce farmland <reference identifier="43" />. These conditions strain the agricultural industry, whose
    best solution is increasing crop production efficiency at the level of individual plants. One issue inhibiting
    greater production efficiency is the inefficiency of photosynthesis, the primary energy source for plants. Several
    studies suggest that photosynthesis only converts a maximum of 4.6% of solar energy into energy stored in biomass
    <reference identifier="44" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although many aspects of photosynthesis do not efficiently convert energy, our team focused on the regenerative
    segment of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. The CBB cycle reactions convert carbon dioxide into organic
    carbon. The regenerative segment of the cycle recycles portions of the carbon compounds into
    ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to allow continuous cycle activity. The major inefficiency of this portion stems
    from the intermediates being consumed in other metabolic processes. Our team selected this portion of the cycle as
    our target for redesign due to a clear solution; if enzymes could be introduced to circumvent some steps, thereby
    reducing the number of intermediates available to leave the cycle, RuBP regeneration efficiency could be increased.
    By increasing RuBP regeneration, growth rate could be improved by creating a more continuous and efficient
    photosynthetic cycle.

  <h2>Our Project</h2>
  <p>
    To model plant metabolomics, our group used cyanobacterial strain <em>Synechococcus elongatus</em> PCC 7942 as our
    chassis. Photosynthesis, especially the CBB cycle, is well conserved across photosynthetic organisms. Cyanobacteria
    make an excellent model organism for crop plants for a variety of reasons, particularly due to the ease of genetic
    manipulation compared to eukaryotic organisms <reference identifier="45" />.

    Potential metabolic redesigns for RuBP regeneration were thoroughly investigated via computational modeling. Two
    potential pathways were explored: the transaldolase pathway and the glycolaldehyde pathway. Between these pathways,
    our team proceeded to test the transaldolase pathway in vivo. The fully redesigned pathway requires the deletion of
    <em>glpX</em>, which encodes SBPase, and the overexpression of <em>tal</em>, encoding transaldolase. SBPase
    dephosphorylates sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) and is present in the
    native CBB cycle (Figure 1). By knocking out SBPase and overexpressing <em>tal</em>, which catalyzes the reversible
    conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to S7P and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    (G3P), the redesigned pathway reduces the number of intermediates that can be consumed in other reactions (Figure
    1). We additionally investigated the effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (<em>fbp</em>) overexpression, finding
    that it could help drive our pathway in conjunction with <em>tal </em>overexpression.
  </p>
  <p>
    SBPase is an essential protein, and therefore cannot be deleted before giving its relevant pathway an alternative.
    To address this issue, our team first induced the overexpression of transaldolase to allow cell survival of SBPase
    deletion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, this reduction of the number of intermediates in the regenerative segment of the CBB cycle allows fewer
    metabolic processes to slow down the regeneration of RuBP by skipping two steps of the CBB cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our project also significantly focused on educational and dialogue-based outreach in order to give our community a
    scientifically accurate foundation of GMO knowledge, detailed on our
    <a href="/Education">Education page</a>. We targeted two age groups: elementary school children and older adults.
    For the elementary students we created informational resources and interactive games that educators could
    incorporate into their lesson plans, and we distributed those to local schools and a museum. For our outreach to
    older adults, we held a presentation and conversation at our local adult care home. Both of these efforts focused on
    building knowledge for the creation of GMOs. If our community has an accurate understanding of the science of GMOs,
    then discussions about projects like ours can go further, and we can create a more educated community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our educational components also expanded to photosynthesis as a general process. We submitted a manuscript on the
    light to dark transition in photosynthesis for the Frontiers for Young Minds journal, linked on the
    <a href="/Education">Education page</a>, describing research accomplished using genetic modification and providing
    open access material on photosynthetic complexity.

  <h2>Our Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    Our team was able to successfully model our alternative pathway and generate predictive results of how these
    redesigned pathways would affect cell physiology and biomass generation, detailed on our
    <a href="/Model">Computational Modeling page</a>.

    Our team also expanded the iGEM Partâ€™s Registry in terms of cyanobacterial parts, submitting 40 parts described on
    our <a href="/Contribution">Contributions</a> and <a href="/Parts">Parts</a> pages, incorporated into our 4
    plasmids. We were able to achieve successful transformation with all our plasmids in our photosynthetic chassis
    organism. Due to the multiple genome copies and time restraints of the competition, however, we have not yet
    achieved total segregation for transformants.
  </p>
  <p>
    In wet lab, we were able to successfully transform the overexpression genes into the cyanobacteria. Due to SBPase
    being previously established as an essential enzyme, we had doubts that we would be able to knock it out completely
    without first implementing an alternative pathway. However, there was evidence that it was knocked out of at least a
    few copies of the genome because the strains transformed with the pGEM-SBPase plasmid showed a resistance to
    antibiotics encoded in the plasmid.

    We did have colonies successfully transformed with overexpression genes for transaldolase,
    fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and both genes. These results are further detailed in our
    <a href="/Proof_Of_Concept">Proof of Concept</a> page, but to provide a brief overview; the growth experiment
    results demonstrated that the overexpression of FBPase and transaldolase simultaneously was more effective in the
    regeneration of the CBB cycle than overexpression of either alone (Figure 2). This finding can be explained by the
    successful activation of our transaldolase pathway, the logic of which is detailed on our
    <a href="/Proof_Of_Concept">Proof of Concept</a> page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even with overexpression of both tal and FBPase, however, there was less growth than the wild type culture (Figure
    3). This is likely due to the presence of functional SBPase, as the SBPase and transaldolase pathways are actively
    competing for substrates and could limit growth. Therefore, we expect that our tal-fbp strains would exhibit growth
    comparable or even outcompeting that of the wildtype strains once undergoing full SBPase deletion.
