<h1>Safety</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Our iGEM team is modifying photosynthesis through the creation of genetically modified cyanobacteria. Although our
    selected strain is nonpathogenic and poses no direct threat to humans or animals, responsible lab safety requires
    active prevention of exposure to biological dangers or the accidental release of organisms. This is especially a
    priority regarding genetically engineered organisms. Wet lab work demands that organisms are contained within the lab,
    waste is properly disposed, and workers are kept safe from hazardous materials. The pandemic introduced additional
    safety concerns which we were able to navigate by using collaborative online platforms and by following the Miami
    University regulations for lab research.

      <h2>Safety in Project Design</h2>
      <p>
        Safety and security begin with project design, as decisions in this phase can significantly limit the risks of
        wet lab work. Thus, all organisms used in our project fall under Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1).
      </p>
      <p>
        We selected a non-pathogenic chassis in <em>Synechococcus elongatus </em>PCC 7942<em>. S. elongatus</em> PCC
        7942 has no current evidence of cytotoxin production or cytotoxicity, and is considered the gold standard as a
        safe host for future biotechnological experimentation and production <reference identifier="6" />. This
        freshwater cyanobacteria is not harmful to humans, making it an extremely safe model organism for laboratory
        work, similar to the decision made by the <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:UCSC/Safety">2017 UCSC</a> team,
        who used the same model organism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cyanobacteria strain we selected is naturally competent and reliable for transformation
        <reference identifier="5" />. However, this strain is not ideal for the cloning of plasmids. We selected
        <em>Escherichia coli strain </em>DH10β<em> </em>to clone and replicate our plasmids. This nonpathogenic strain
        is a derivative of <em>E. coli </em>K12,<em> </em>a lab strain of <em>E. coli</em> in Risk Group 1, and is
        commonly used in iGEM projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our plasmids use antibiotic resistance markers to identify successful transformants, specifically for kanamycin,
        streptomycin and spectinomycin. Even though the organisms these markers were implemented into are not inherently
        pathogenic, antibiotic resistance genes are able to transfer between bacterial species, contributing to the
        ever-growing issue of widespread antibiotic resistance. In the wild, cyanobacterial blooms contribute to
        antibiotic gene transfer via conjugation <reference identifier="1" />. The possibility of antibiotic gene
        transfer made it imperative for our team to sterilize all lab waste before disposal and to practice effective
        containment of all organisms within the lab.

          As with any form of laboratory work, it is important to identify where hazards to health and safety may arise.
          From there, a scientist must take precautions to avoid accidents and know how to respond if they do occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          All wet lab work was conducted in Dr. Xin Wang’s lab within the Department of Microbiology at Miami University.
          This project was executed under the guidance and supervision of either Dr. Wang or his graduate students Shaun
          Jiang and Shrameeta Shinde, who all regularly work with the techniques we used for this project in their regular
          studies on metabolic engineering with cyanobacteria. We are extremely grateful to this team for teaching us
          proper safety protocols and assisting in their implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a BSL-1 lab, there were clear guidelines that each student followed. Appropriate clothing (long pants, tied
          back hair, closed toe shoes) and safety equipment such as gloves were always worn when conducting experiments.
          No food or drink was allowed into the lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          While most of the components used in wet lab work were safe, a major exception was the ethidium bromide used for
          DNA visualization during gel electrophoresis. This intercalating agent is hazardous due to its carcinogenic
          properties. As such, ethidium bromide and its associated materials were always handled with gloves in a
          designated gel electrophoresis area. All equipment used in this area was considered contaminated with ethidium
          bromide, and thus items such as pipettes and ingredient containers were kept in this area and not handled
          without gloves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any other reagents used were for standard protocols and were commercially available from reputable suppliers.
          Many of our protocols and supply kits for plasmid work came from <a href="https://www.neb.com/">NEB</a>, which
          has publicly available protocols detailing safe and efficient use of materials. Gloves were changed regularly to
          limit contamination and spread of any chemical or biological agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our lab was also equipped with a variety of equipment for proper handling of microbial organisms. A vertical
          laminar airflow hood was used for all processes involving transformation or transfer of microbial organisms,
          limiting risks of contamination to the colonies and ourselves. All biological waste was sterilized by autoclave
          before being sent to designated university waste disposal services for the Microbiology Department. Similarly,
          all pipette tips, centrifuge tubes or other disposable wastes were autoclaved and disposed of by university
          services. We further noted the location of important safety features such as the glass waste disposal, a fire
          extinguisher, a safety shower, and an eyewash station.

          With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of new strains, it was imperative to limit in-person
          contact and take precautions when contact couldn’t be avoided. Remote team meetings over Google Meet were
          utilized to allow team members to communicate and organize without risking the spread of disease. When local
          ordinances and university guidelines allowed, we held in-person meetings. In these meetings, team members
          socially distanced and wore masks, excluding brief team photos when given administrative permission. In response
          to the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, Miami University has reimplemented the requirement to wear a mask
          on campus while indoors. All wet lab workers, which totaled 4 student team members, wore masks and socially
          distanced themselves during lab work. Although wet lab workers were fully vaccinated, they were still expected
          to perform health assessments at home before reporting to the lab.

  <h2>Genetic Engineering</h2>
<p>
  Due to the possibility of modifications in cyanobacteria being implemented into edible crops, our project raises
<<<<<<< HEAD
  concerns on the safety of genetically modified organism (GMO) consumption. Genetic engineering has its foundations in
  the selective breeding of plants thousands of years ago, when people picked out the tallest wheat or the largest
  potatoes to be bred for next year’s crop. Today, humans are able to manipulate genomes directly using recombinant DNA
  technology. This purposeful creation of altered organisms allows rapid integration of desired traits, accomplishing
  what may have taken centuries in just a matter of weeks. This process also allows for new traits to be introduced that
  a plant may otherwise lack. A famous example is Golden Rice. Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice strain with
  corn and bacterial DNA added to its genome to produce a vitamin A precursor, beta carotene
  <reference identifier="13" />.

  Today, humans can directly manipulate genomes using recombinant DNA technology. This purposeful creation of altered
  organisms allows rapid integration of desired traits, accomplishing what may have taken centuries in just a matter of
  weeks. This process also allows for new traits to be introduced that a plant may otherwise lack. A famous example is
  <a href="https://www.goldenrice.org/">Golden Rice</a>. Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice strain with corn and
  bacterial DNA added to its genome to produce beta carotene, a vitamin A precursor <reference identifier="32" />.
  Consumption of this precursor could alleviate the widespread vitamin A deficiencies in Asia and Africa, yet the strain
  has not been widely adopted.
</p>
<p>
  One major hurdle is the popular belief that GMOs are not safe for human consumption. For all food research, the
  established safety standard is to declare an absence of danger in a food rather than declare definitive safety. The
  conclusion that GMOs are safe for human consumption has been supported in over 100 peer reviewed research studies, and
  has been endorsed by the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization <reference identifier="14" />.
  Despite the clear evidence for safety, there is widespread doubt and concern over GMO consumption. This likely stems
  from a lack of education and understanding on GMO creation and verification, as the greatest impact on GMO perception
  is education. One study found that 62% of people in the US with a high school education or less consider GMOs unsafe,
  compared to only 38% of people with post-graduate degrees believing them unsafe <reference identifier="36" />.
</p>
<p>
  GMOs have clear benefits. GMO crops have higher yields and their pathogen infection resistance decreases complications
  with those yields. Despite the impressive body of evidence on the benefits and safety of GMOs, little more than a
  third of the world supports GMO consumption <reference identifier="35" />. The most common concern is the
  unintentional creation of toxins, allergens, or altered nutrition. This fear stems from the idea that foreign genes
  are being put into an organism. If one does not understand how GMOs are created, the unknown process of putting things
  from one organism into another starts to look scary. Thus, one of the biggest obstacles against GMO integration into
  society is not the successful engineering of organisms, but tackling this public resistance, primarily by increasing
  education and trust in the process. We need to show that our project is not the endeavor of mad scientists, but a safe
  and controlled procedure that draws from natural processes.
</p>
<p>
  Our team approached this challenge from two angles, in both our inherent project design and
  <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:MiamiU_OH/Education">educational outreach</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Our engineering approach does not introduce any synthetic genes to the cyanobacteria, primarily manipulating the
  expression of native genes. We are deleting the native gene encoding SBPase, increasing the expression of the native
  transaldolase gene, and introducing a FBPase gene from <em>E. coli. </em>In cyanobacteria, the SBPase gene is dual
  functional, also encoding FBPase functions. In order to remove SBPase, we therefore also remove the vital FBPase, thus
  we must provide a new monofunctional FBPase. This additional gene is well characterized to produce only an FBPase, the
  reaction of which is normally present in cyanobacteria. Therefore, no reasonable risk of dangerous side reactions or
  toxic products is predicted.
</p>
<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Our team approached this challenge from two angles, in both our inherent project design and
  <a href="/Education">educational outreach</a>. Firstly, our engineering approach does not introduce any foreign genes to
  the cyanobacteria. We are deleting one gene, encoding SBPase, and forcing the cell to express an additional copy of
  its own FBPase gene. By only using native genes, we hope to give our project a strong opening in conversations about
  the fears of GMOs. All of our manipulations were accomplished with genes already in the organism, we simply modified
  how much protein gets made from the genes that are already making their given protein. This process already occurs
  organically through natural selection. For example, a plant may be pressured to start expressing more of a growth gene
  to grow taller and get more sunlight. We’re simply directing the process to achieve a specific goal. The second branch
  of this problem lies in education; it is very difficult to be scared of something once one understands it. Our team
  believes educational outreach can make major strides in improving public opinion on GMOs.

  <h2>Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
<p>
  Antibiotic resistance markers are a common method for selecting desired genetically altered cell lines in molecular
  biology research. Although the use of antibiotic resistance genes greatly increases the ease and efficiency of
  microbial research, there is the possibility of problematic horizontal gene transfer. Through horizontal gene transfer
  bacteria can transfer resistance genes to one another and even multiple species throughout their surrounding
  environment <reference identifier="7" />. This allows antibiotic genes to transfer to bacterial species or strains
  that had previously been susceptible to antibiotics.
</p>
<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Throughout the world, the spread of antibiotic resistance genes is contributing to a growing crisis of drug resistance
  in pathogenic bacteria, limiting treatment options for patients. It should be noted that current pioneering research
  is exploring the use of metabolic gene markers as an alternative to antibiotic resistance markers. Metabolic gene
  markers only allow transformed cell lines to grow on minimal media
  <reference identifier="8" />. While this is a viable alternative to potentially dangerous antibiotic resistance
  markers, metabolic gene markers have not yet been widely adopted. A genetic engineering project has the ethical
  responsibility to understand the issue of antibiotic resistance spread, mitigate it, and assure the public of how this
  technique safely operates in labs around the world.

  incorporated our desired genetic constructs. These antibiotics have current uses in the medical field,<sup
    ><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup
  >
  but only under extreme and otherwise unmanageable conditions. Our nonpathogenic cyanobacteria do not express
  antibiotic resistance well. The antibiotics that we used are also less purified and at a lower dose than medical-grade
  antibiotics. Our concentration of antibiotics is approximately 5 μg/mL for our selection process, whereas medical
<<<<<<< HEAD
  usage is typically over a dozen times more concentrated. These factors greatly limit the danger of materializing

<p>
  Additionally, a variety of laboratory techniques are designed to limit, or ideally eliminate, the risk of genetically
  modified organisms escaping the lab environment. Our work areas are consistently sterilized before and after cellular
  work. Materials in contact with the cells such as gloves, media plates, or pipette tips are autoclaved before
  disposal. All cell lines, aside from those stored within the lab for future work, are also killed by autoclave
  sterilization when work is completed.
