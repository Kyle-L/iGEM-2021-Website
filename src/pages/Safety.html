  <h1>Safety</h1>

<p>
  Our iGEM team is modifying photosynthesis through the creation of genetically modified cyanobacteria strains. While
  our selected strain is non-pathogenic and poses no direct threat to humans or animals, responsible lab safety requires
  active prevention of exposure to biological dangers or accidental release of the organism. This is especially a
  priority regarding genetically engineered organisms. Wet lab work demands that organisms are contained within the lab,
  waste is properly disposed, and workers are kept safe from hazardous materials. The pandemic introduced additional
  safety concerns which we were able to navigate by using collaborative online platforms and by following the Miami
  University regulations for lab research.

        <p>
          Safety and security begin with project design, as decisions in this phase can significantly limit the risks of
          wet lab work. Thus, all organisms used in our project fall under Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1).
        </p>
        <p>
          We selected a non-pathogenic chassis in <em>Synechococcus elongatus </em>PCC 7942<em>. S. elongatus</em> PCC
          7942 has no current evidence of cytotoxin production or cytotoxicity, and is considered the gold standard as a
          safe host for future biotechnological experimentation and production <reference identifier="6" />. This
          freshwater cyanobacteria is not harmful to humans, making it an extremely safe model organism for laboratory
          work, similar to the decision made by the <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:UCSC/Safety">2017 UCSC</a> team,
          who used the same model organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cyanobacteria strain we selected is naturally competent and reliable for transformation
          <reference identifier="5" />.However, this strain is not ideal for the cloning of plasmids. We selected
          <em>Escherichia coli strain </em>DH10β<em> </em>to clone and replicate our plasmids. This nonpathogenic strain
          is a derivative of <em>E. coli </em>K12,<em> </em>a lab strain of <em>E. coli</em> in Risk Group 1, and is
          commonly used in iGEM projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our plasmids use antibiotic resistance markers to identify successful transformants, specifically for
          kanamycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin. Even though the organisms these markers were implemented into are
          not inherently pathogenic, antibiotic resistance genes are able to transfer between bacterial species,
          contributing to the ever-growing issue of widespread antibiotic resistance. In the wild, cyanobacterial blooms
          contribute to antibiotic gene transfer via conjugation <reference identifier="1" />. The possibility of
          antibiotic gene transfer made it imperative for our team to sterilize all lab waste before disposal and to
          practice effective containment of all organisms within the lab.

        <p>
          As with any form of laboratory work, it is important to identify where hazards to health and safety may arise.
          From there, a scientist must take the precautions to avoid accidents and to know how to respond if they do
          occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          All wet lab work was conducted in Dr. Xin Wang’s lab within the Department of Microbiology at Miami
          University. This project was executed under the guidance and supervision of either Dr. Wang or his graduate
          students Shaun Jiang and Shrameeta Shinde, who all regularly work with the techniques we used for this project
          in their regular studies on metabolic engineering with cyanobacteria. We are extremely grateful to this team
          for teaching us proper safety protocols and assisting in their implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a BSL-1, there were clear guidelines that each student followed. Appropriate clothing (long pants, tied
          back hair, closed toe shoes) and safety equipment such as gloves were always worn when conducting experiments.
          No food or drink was allowed into the lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          While most of the components used in wet lab work were safe, a major exception was the ethidium bromide used
          for DNA visualization during gel electrophoresis. This intercalating agent is hazardous due to its mutagenic
          properties. As such, ethidium bromide and its associated materials were always handled with gloves in a
          designated gel electrophoresis area. All equipment used in this area is considered contaminated with ethidium
          bromide, and thus items such as pipettes and ingredient containers are kept in this area and not handled
          unless gloves are worn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any other reagents used were for standard protocols and were commercially available from reputable suppliers.
          Many of our protocols and supply kits for plasmid work came from <a href="https://www.neb.com">NEB</a>, which
          has publicly available protocols detailing safe and efficient use of materials. Gloves were changed regularly
          to limit contamination and spread of any chemical or biological agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our lab was also equipped with a variety of equipment for proper handling of microbial organisms. A vertical
          laminar airflow hood was used for all processes involving transformation or transfer of microbial organisms,
          limiting risks of contamination to the colonies and ourselves. All biological waste is sterilized by autoclave
          before being sent to designated university waste disposal services for the Microbiology Department. Similarly,
          all pipette tips, centrifuge tubes or other disposable wastes ereis autoclaved and disposed of by university
          services. We further noted the location of important safety features such as the glass waste disposal, a fire
          extinguisher, a safety shower, and an eyewash station.

        <h2>Safety During Covid-19</h2>
        <span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the arising new strains, it was imperative to limit in-person
          contact and take precautions when it couldn’t be avoided. Remote team meetings over Google Meet were utilized
          to allow team members to communicate and organize without risking the spread of disease. When local ordinances
          and university guidelines allowed, we held in-person meetings. In these meetings, team members sat 6 feet away
          from each other and wore masks. In response to the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, Miami University has
          reimplemented the requirement to wear a mask on campus while indoors. All wet lab workers, which totalled 3
          student team members, wore masks and socially distanced themselves during lab work. While the wet lab workers
          were fully vaccinated, they were still expected to perform health assessments at home before reporting to the
          lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          In consideration of the alarming spread of new variants, Miami University reimplemented the requirement to
          wear a mask indoors on campus just as wet lab work was beginning. Faculty and students were, and still are,
          expected to follow this rule regardless of vaccination status. When participating in wet lab activities, all 3
          student workers wore a mask and were expected to self-monitor for potential symptoms and stay home if there
          was cause for concern.

  <h2>Genetic engineering- AI</h2>
  <p>
    Due to the possibility of modifications in cyanobacteria being implemented into edible crops, our project raises
    concerns on the safety of genetically modified organism (GMO) consumption. Genetic engineering has its foundations in
    the selective breeding of plants thousands of years ago, when people picked out the tallest wheat or the largest
    potatoes to be bred for next year’s crop. Today, humans are able to manipulate genomes directly using recombinant DNA
    technology. This purposeful creation of altered organisms allows rapid integration of desired traits, accomplishing
    what may have taken centuries in just a matter of weeks. This process also allows for new traits to be introduced that
    a plant may otherwise lack. A famous example is Golden Rice. Golden RIce is a genetically modified rice strain with
    corn and bacterial DNA added to its genome to produce a vitamin A precursor, beta carotene <reference identifier="13" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consumption of this precursor could alleviate the widespread vitamin A deficiencies in Asia and Africa, yet the strain
    has not been widely adopted. One major hurdle is the popular belief that GMOs are not safe for human consumption. The
    established standard for <em>all </em>food research is to declare that there is an absence of danger, not that the
    product is definitely safe. As one
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/well/eat/are-gmo-foods-safe.html">New York Times article</a> elegantly
    explains, it “is not possible to prove a food is safe, only to say that no hazard has been shown to exist.” This
    However, the conclusion that GMOs are safe for human consumption has been supported in over 100 peer reviewed research
    studies, and has been endorsed by the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization <reference identifier="14" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    GMOs have clear benefits. GMO crops have higher yields and their pathogen infection resistance decreases toxins
    present in those yields. Despite the impressive body of evidence on the benefits and safety of GMOs, little more than
    a third of the world supports GMO consumption (NYT article). The most common concern is the unintentional creation of
    toxins, allergens, or altered nutrition. This fear stems from the idea that foreign genes are being put into an
    organism. If one does not understand how GMOs are created, the unknown process of putting things from one organism
    into another starts to look scary. Thus, one of the biggest obstacles against GMO integration into society is not the
    successful engineering of organisms, but tackling public resistance. We need to show that our project is not the
    endeavor of a bunch of mad scientists, but actually a safe and controlled procedure that draws from natural processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team approached this challenge from two angles, in both our inherent and 
    <a href="/Education"></a>education outreach</a>. Firstly, our engineering approach does not introduce any foreign genes to the
    cyanobacteria. We are deleting one gene, encoding SBPase, and forcing the cell to express an additional copy of its
    own FBPase gene. By only using native genes, we hope to give our project a strong opening in conversations about the
    fears of GMOs. All of our manipulations were accomplished with genes already in the organism, we simply modified how
    much protein gets made from the genes that are already making their given protein. This process already occurs
    organically through natural selection. For example, a plant may be pressured to start expressing more of a growth gene
    to grow taller and get more sunlight. We’re simply directing the process to achieve a specific goal. The second branch
    of this problem lies in education; it is very difficult to be scared of something once one understands it. Our team
    believes educational outreach can make major strides in improving public opinion on GMOs.

  <h2>Antibiotic resistance- DP</h2>
  <p>
    Antibiotic resistance markers are a common method for selecting desired genetically altered cell lines in molecular
    biology research. Although the use of antibiotic resistance genes greatly increases the ease and efficiency of
    microbial research, there is the possibility of problematic horizontal gene transfer. Through horizontal gene transfer
    bacteria are able to transfer resistance genes to one another and even multiple species throughout their surrounding
    environment <reference identifier="7" />. This creates the possibility of antibiotic genes being transferred to bacterial species or strains
    that had previously been susceptible to antibiotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the world, the spread of antibiotic resistance genes is contributing to a growing crisis of drug resistance
    in pathogenic bacteria, limiting treatment options for patients. It should be noted that current pioneering research
    is exploring the use of metabolic gene markers as an alternative to antibiotic resistance markers. Metabolic gene
    markers only allow transformed cell lines to grow on minimal media <reference identifier="8" />. While this is a viable alternative to
    potentially dangerous antibiotic resistance markers, metabolic gene markers have not yet been widely adopted. A
    genetic engineering project has the ethical responsibility to understand the issue of antibiotic resistance spread,
    mitigate it, and assure the public of how this technique safely operates in labs around the world
  </p>
  <p>
    Our project used gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance genes to select for cells that
    incorporated our desired genetic constructs. These antibiotics have current uses in the medical field<sup
      ><sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-ref-0">[1]</a></sup></sup
    >, but only under extreme and otherwise unmanageable conditions. Our nonpathogenic cyanobacteria do not express
    antibiotic resistance well. The antibiotics that we used are also less purified and at a lower dose than medical-grade
    antibiotics. Our concentration of antibiotics is approximately 5 μg/mL for our selection process, whereas medical
    usage is typically over a dozen times more concentrated. These factors greatly limit the danger of materializing
    antibiotic resistance within our model organism
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, a variety of laboratory techniques are designed to limit, or ideally eliminate, the risk of genetically
    modified organisms escaping the lab environment. Our work areas are consistently sterilized before and after cellular
    work. Materials in contact with the cells such as gloves, media plates, or pipette tips are autoclaved before
    disposal. All cell lines, aside from those stored within the lab for future work, are also killed by autoclave
    sterilization when work is completed.
