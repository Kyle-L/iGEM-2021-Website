        Avery Imes is a senior microbiology major. She helped establish Miami
        University's iGEM team because she sees it as a great opportunity to
        design and complete a challenging research project at a level of depth
        not typically seen in a classroom. To her, iGEM represents a great
        opportunity to push her understanding of science while addressing
        everyday issues; issues which she wants to play an active role in
        creating solutions to. iGEM also serves as a great opportunity for Avery
        to gain collaborative experience which she sees as a vital skill needed
        in her future as a microbiologist.

        Daria Perminova is a junior biology major. She was drawn to the iGEM
        team because of its relation to the global food crisis; it was an
        exciting opportunity to be a part of something bigger than herself since
        it is a real and ever-pressing issue. By joining the team, Daria hopes
        to expand her research experience and explore the relatively new field
        of synthetic biology, helping her navigate the many career choices that
        await her as a future research scientist.

        Hope Kirby is a senior majoring in microbiology with an unsurprising
        love of science. She finds systems and synthetic biology a unique
        challenge, representing a different form of thinking about biological
        problems than typically seen in a classroom. This perspective drew her
        towards helping establish the Miami University iGEM team, allowing her
        to challenge herself as an innovator rather than an observer while
        expanding her experience in what she believes will become the new
        foundation of modern scientific work.
