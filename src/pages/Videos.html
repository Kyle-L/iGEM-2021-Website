    <b>Description: </b>A major inefficiency of photosynthesis is in the regeneration of Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
    (RuBP) during the Calvin cycle. Through genetic engineering, our team will disrupt the typical pathway of the Calvin
    cycle and implement the enzyme transaldolase, allowing the cycle to be streamlined for a more continuous and robust
    regeneration of RuBP. This could vastly improve agricultural productivity by providing a mechanism to boost plant
    growth.

    <b>Description: </b>Global agricultural productivity is projected to not meet the needs of increasing populations
    developing higher standards of living. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of
    photosynthesis. Our project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative RuBP regeneration portion
    of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other reactions that act
    on common metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling. Impacts on growth and
    reaction fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust photosynthetic cycle.
    One of these pathways which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed in vivo. Ultimately, we
    showed the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration stage of the CBB Cycle.
    These pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust cycling and therefore higher
    crop yield.
